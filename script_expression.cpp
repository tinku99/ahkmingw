// v1.0.40.02: This is now a separate file to allow its compiler optimization settings
// to be set independently of those of the other modules.  In one benchmark, this
// improved performance of expressions and function calls by 9% (that is, when the
// other modules are set to "minmize size" such as for the AutoHotkeySC.bin file).
// This gain in performance is at the cost of a 1.5 KB increase in the size of the
// compressed code, which seems well worth it given how often expressions and
// function-calls are used (such as in loops).
//
// ExpandArgs() and related functions were also put into this file because that
// further improves performance across the board -- even for AutoHotkey.exe despite
// the fact that the only thing that changed for it was the module move, not the
// compiler settings.  Apparently, the butterfly effect can cause even minor
// modifications to impact the overall performance of the generated code by as much as
// 7%.  However, this might have more to do with cache hits and misses in the CPU than
// with the nature of the code produced by the compiler.
// UPDATE 10/18/2006: There's not much difference anymore -- in fact, using min size
// for everything makes compiled scripts slightly faster in basic benchmarks, probably
// due to the recent addition of the linker optimization that physically orders
// functions in a better order inside the EXE.  Therefore, script_expression.cpp no
// longer has a separate "favor fast code" option.

			{
				// NOTE 1: v1.0.46: The IS_ASSIGNMENT_EXCEPT_POST_AND_PRE line above was added in conjunction with
				// the new assignment operators (e.g. := and +=). Here's what it does: Normally, the assignment
				// operators have the lowest precedence of all (except for commas) because things that lie
				// to the *right* of them in the infix expression should be evaluated first to be stored
				// as the assignment's result.  However, if what lies to the *left* of the assignment
				// operator isn't a valid lvalue/variable (and not even a unary like -x can produce an lvalue
				// because they're not supposed to alter the contents of the variable), obeying the normal
				// precedence rules would be produce a syntax error due to "assigning to non-lvalue".
				// So instead, apply any pending operator on the stack (which lies to the left of the lvalue
				// in the infix expression) *after* the assignment by leaving it on the stack.  For example,
				// C++ and probably other langauges (but not the older ANSI C) evaluate "true ? x:=1 : y:=1"
				// as a pair of assignments rather than as who-knows-what (probably a syntax error if you
				// strictly followed precedence).  Similarly, C++ evaluates "true ? var1 : var2 := 3" not as
				// "(true ? var1 : var2) := 3" (like ANSI C) but as "true ? var1 : (var2 := 3)".  Other examples:
				// -> not var:=5 ; It's evaluated contrary to precedence as: not (var:=5) [PHP does this too,
				//    and probably others]
				// -> 5 + var+=5 ; It's evaluated contrary to precedence as: 5 + (var+=5) [not sure if other
				//    languages do ones like this]
				// -> ++i := 5 ; Silly since increment has no lasting effect; so assign the 5 then do the pre-inc.
				// -> ++i /= 5 ; Valid, but maybe too obscure and inconsistent to treat it differently than
				//    the others (especially since not many people will remember that unlike i++, ++i produces
				//    an lvalue); so divide by 5 then do the increment.
				// -> i++ := 5 (and i++ /= 5) ; Postfix operator can't produce an lvalue, so do the assignment
				//    first and then the postfix op.
				// SYM_DEREF is the only exception to the above because there's a slight chance that
				// *Var:=X (evaluated strictly according to precedence as (*Var):=X) will be used for someday.
				// Also, SYM_FUNC seems unaffected by any of this due to its enclosing parentheses (i.e. even
				// if a function-call can someday generate an lvalue [SYM_VAR], the current rules probably
				// already support it.
				// Performance: Adding the above behavior reduced the expressions benchmark by only 0.6%; so
				// it seems worth it.
				//
				// NOTE 2: The SYM_POWER line above is a workaround to allow 2**-2 (and others in v1.0.45) to be
				// evaluated as 2**(-2) rather than being seen as an error.  However, as of v1.0.46, consecutive
				// unary operators are supported via the right-to-left evaluation flag above (formerly, consecutive
				// unaries produced a failure [blank value]).  For example:
				// !!x  ; Useful to convert a blank value into a zero for use with unitialized variables.
				// not not x  ; Same as above.
				// Other examples: !-x, -!x, !&x, -&Var, ~&Var
				// And these deref ones (which worked even before v1.0.46 by different means: giving
				// '*' a higher precedence than the other unaries): !*Var, -*Var and ~*Var
				// !x  ; Supported even if X contains a negative number, since x is recognized as an isolated operand and not something containing unary minus.
				//
				// To facilitate short-circuit boolean evaluation, right before an AND/OR/IFF is pushed onto the
				// stack, point the end of it's left branch to it.  Note that the following postfix token
				// can itself be of type AND/OR/IFF, a simple example of which is "if (true and true and true)",
				// in which the first and's parent (in an imaginary tree) is the second "and".
				// But how is it certain that this is the final operator or operand of and AND/OR/IFF's left branch?
				// Here is the explanation:
				// Everything higher precedence than the AND/OR/IFF came off the stack right before it, resulting in
				// what must be a balanced/complete sub-postfix-expression in and of itself (unless the expression
				// has a syntax error, which is caught in various places).  Because it's complete, during the
				// postfix evaluation phase, that sub-expression will result in a new operand for the stack,
				// which must then be the left side of the AND/OR/IFF because the right side immediately follows it
				// within the postfix array, which in turn is immediately followed its operator (namely AND/OR/IFF).
				// Also, the final result of an IFF's condition-branch must point to the IFF/THEN symbol itself
				// because that's the means by which the condition is merely "checked" rather than becoming an
				// operand itself.

					// Thus, such attempts will cause the expression as a whole to fail and evaluate to ""

end:
	// As of v1.0.31, there can be multiple deref buffers simultaneously if one or more called functions
	// requires a deref buffer of its own (separate from ours).  In addition, if a called function is
	// interrupted by a new thread before it finishes, the interrupting thread will also use the
	// new/separate deref buffer.  To minimize the amount of memory used in such cases cases,
	// each line containing one or more expression with one or more function call (rather than each
	// function call) will get up to one deref buffer of its own (i.e. only if its function body contains
	// commands that actually require a second deref buffer).  This is achieved by saving sDerefBuf's
	// pointer and setting sDerefBuf to NULL, which effectively makes the original deref buffer private
	// until the line that contains the function-calling expressions finishes completely.
	// Description of recursion and usage of multiple deref buffers:
	// 1) ExpandArgs() receives a line with one or more expressions containing one or more calls to user functions.
	// 2) Worst-case: those function-calls create a new sDerefBuf automatically via us having set sDerefBuf to NULL.
	// 3) Even worse, the bodies of those functions call other functions, which ExpandArgs() receives, resulting in
	//    a recursive leap back to step #1.
	// So the above shows how any number of new deref buffers can be created.  But that's okay as long as the
	// recursion collapses in an orderly manner (or the program exits, in which case the OS frees all its memory
	// automatically).  This is because prior to returning, each recursion layer properly frees any extra deref
	// buffer it was responsible for creating.  It only has to free at most one such buffer because each layer of
	// ExpandArgs() on the call-stack can never be blamed for creating more than one extra buffer.

	// made by our calls to ExpandExpression() will now be done.  There might still be layers
	// of ExpandArgs() beneath us on the call-stack, which is okay since they will keep the
	// largest of the two available deref bufs (as described above) and thus they should
	// reset the timer below right before they collapse/return.
	// (Re)set the timer unconditionally so that it starts counting again from time zero.
	// In other words, we only want the timer to fire when the large deref buffer has been
	// unused/idle for a straight 10 seconds.  There is no danger of this timer freeing
	// the deref buffer at a critical moment because:
	// 1) The timer is reset with each call to ExpandArgs (this function);
	// 2) If our ExpandArgs() recursion layer takes a long time to finish, messages
	//    won't be checked and thus the timer can't fire because it relies on the msg loop.
	// 3) If our ExpandArgs() recursion layer launches function-calls in ExpandExpression(),
	//    those calls will call ExpandArgs() recursively and reset the timer if its
	//    buffer (not necessarily the original buffer somewhere on the call-stack) is large
	//    enough.  In light of this, there is a chance that the timer might execute and free
	//    a deref buffer other than the one it was originally intended for.  But in real world
	//    scenarios, that seems rare.  In addition, the consequences seem to be limited to
	//    some slight memory inefficiency.
	// It could be aruged that the timer should only be activated when a hypothetical static
	// var sLayersthat we maintain here indicates that we're the only layer.  However, if that
	// were done and the launch of a script function creates (directly or through thread
