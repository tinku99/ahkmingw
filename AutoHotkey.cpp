	// In other words, the only purpose of AutoExecSectionTimeout() is to handle cases where
	// the AutoExecute section takes a long time to complete, or never completes (perhaps because

	// Save the values of KeyDelay, WinDelay etc. in case they were changed by the auto-execute part

	// affecting the settings for other subroutines:
	global_clear_state(g);  // Start with a "clean slate" in both g and g_default.
	CopyMemory(&g_default, &g, sizeof(global_struct)); // Above has set g.IsPaused==false in case it's ever possible that it's true as a result of AutoExecSection().
	// After this point, the values in g_default should never be changed.

	// It seems best to set ErrorLevel to NONE after the auto-execute part of the script is done.
	// However, we do not set it to NONE right before launching each new hotkey subroutine because
	// it's more flexible that way (i.e. the user may want one hotkey subroutine to use the value of
	// ErrorLevel set by another).  This reset was also done by LoadFromFile(), but we do it again
	// here in case the auto-exectute section changed it:
	g_ErrorLevel->Assign(ERRORLEVEL_NONE);

	// Since we're about to enter the script's idle state, set the "idle thread" to
	// be minimum priority so that it can always be "interrupted" (though technically,
	// there is no actual idle quasi-thread, so it can't really be interrupted):
	g.Priority = PRIORITY_MINIMUM;
	g.ThreadIsCritical = false;            // v1.0.38.04: Prevent the idle thread from being seen as uninterruptible.
	g.AllowTimers = true;                  // v1.0.40.01: Similar to above.
	g.AllowThreadToBeInterrupted = true;   // This is the primary line, the one above is not strictly necessary (just for maintainability).

	// Call it in this special mode to kick off the main event loop.
	// Be sure to pass something >0 for the first param or it will
	// return (and we never want this to return):
	MsgSleep(SLEEP_INTERVAL, WAIT_FOR_MESSAGES);
	return 0; // Never executed; avoids compiler warning.
